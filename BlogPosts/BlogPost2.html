        <article>
            <p>Both short stories emphasise how limitless and incomprehensible the universe is.</p>

            <p>The Library of Babel concludes that the universe is “unlimited yet periodic”, meaning that there is a
                vast
                amount of information but at some point, that information is repeated exactly as it was before. It
                describes
                man’s search for the ultimate truths, about their lives, their deaths and how it was all created. But
                this
                information is unattainable, and even if we were to learn it, it is above our understanding. The loss of
                knowledge which is directly in front of you.</p>

            <p>The Garden of Forking Paths discusses various timelines in which everything is possible. Every decision
                or
                event
                changes the course of time in infinite ways, but all of these are true, hence the timeline “forks”.
                Again, a
                loss of knowledge, knowledge of alternate realities and what ifs.</p>

            <p>I can relate this idea of expanse information and possibility to something more comprehensible, the
                internet.
                Everything one can think of can be found in the internet, and as we learn more, so the internet will
                grow.
                All
                the information we know whether it is true or not and whether we can understand it or not, can, for the
                most
                part, be found on the internet. Like the storage of information in the Library of Babel, perhaps sans
                the
                divine
                truths of the universe. Searching the internet can take one down many different paths of information,
                many
                paths
                conflicting fully or partially, like the forking paths of reality in The Garden of Forking Paths. All
                paths
                exist and are true, and they exist all at once. The path of information you take is due to your choices.
                We
                live
                with all this information at our fingertips, but we can never know it all, our loss of knowledge.</p>
