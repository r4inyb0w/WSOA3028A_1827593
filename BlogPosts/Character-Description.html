            <article>
                <p>Macey Daniels is a 22-year-old florist living in the late 80s in Johannesburg, South Africa. She
                    comes
                    from
                    a
                    strongly opinionated and supportive family. Herself and her family are greatly anti-apartheid and
                    have
                    all,
                    at
                    one time or another, been arrested for it. Macey studied business at university and has taken over
                    her
                    mom’s
                    florist shop. She loves flowers and their meanings and often posts new arrangements on her profile.
                    She
                    likes
                    the “brown paper packaging tied up with string” aesthetic, the florist is designed around this.
                    Light
                    pink walls, lots of plants and woven pots line the walls and windowsills. She is seen as quite
                    feminine
                    and elegant.
                    However, Macey
                    is
                    also a talented graffiti artist. Her dad would let her help him spray-paint the models he would
                    build
                    for
                    work.
                    She’s always loved this medium for artistic expression. Now she uses her spray-painting skills to
                    protest. This alternative expression can be quite surprising to those who know her as the sweet
                    florist.
                    Imagine her as that brown paper package tied up with string, signed with a black marker.
                    She
                    graffities political slogans on public buildings. This has led to the aforementioned arrests, but
                    she
                    will
                    not
                    give up her small part in this fight. She likes to post about this street art and other
                    anti-apartheid
                    things on
                    her profile as well, spreading the message. She is strong-willed and confident. She is creative and
                    sentimental.</p>
