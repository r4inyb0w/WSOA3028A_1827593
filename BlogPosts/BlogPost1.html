            The author describes a future method of storing information, named the memex. This idea is like that of a personal computer with access to the internet. Physically, as Bush describes it, a memex is for “individual use” and is used to store one’s “books, records, and communications” which can all be accessed  with “speed and flexibility”. He mentions the use of screens onto which material can be projected, this is comparable to current computer monitors. Further, the manner of storing material is by microfilm, this is comparable to RAM which is a physically small component which can contain a large amount of information. Additionally, Bush mentions unlimited access to information, by saying the contents, such as “Books of all sorts” can be purchased. This is comparable to the internet. Even though we don’t necessarily buy information directly, we do pay for our internet provider and such. Certain things like eBooks can be purchased and stored on a computer as predicted. Bush describes this transfer of information to be more physical. One must buy a microfilm, which is inserted and, his idea of copying information into memory, was to photograph the information into the memex. Additionally, Bush mentions reproducing the information of one memex in another. This is another comparison to the internet, being able to access various information from one source; being able to copy information between two computers. <br>

            Bush talks about searching for a specific book by typing in a code, like searching for a folder in the file directory. Then he mentions quickly paging through the book to find the relevant information. This is like looking through sub-folders in a folder. “A special button transfers him immediately to the first page of the index” – this can be compared to a return button. An individual can group information of a specific topic in a folder, which can include relative sub-folders. These are easy to search through to find the information required, which is comparable to Bush describing searching a memex as quickly paging through information starting at the head, i.e. starting at the initial folder. <br>

            Alternatively, the idea of the memex can also be compared to Wikipedia. I find that this line describes Wikipedia perfectly - “the enormous mass of the common record”. A memex is meant to store memory like books and photographs. It is used for educational purposes and to progress certain fields. This further describes how Wikipedia is used.<br>
            <br>
            In conclusion, the memex simultaneously describes aspects of modern-day personal computers, use of file directories, the internet in general and specifically Wikipedia.<br>
