        <p>
            During lockdown, the best way for me to hang out with my friends is over Discord. I acknowledge that this in
            itself is an example of privileged access, considering one needs a capable computer and a sizeable amount
            of data to join into this conversation. This is an example of the first stage of the digital divide, "the
            haves and have nots".
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this screenshot of a Discord call I had recently so obviously displays the difference in access
            between us in Johannesburg, South Africa and those in Zagreb, Croatia. All of the participants in this call
            have a fibre connection and reasonable quality cameras.
            It is so obvious that the quality of connection in Zagreb is superior to that in Johannesburg.
        </p>
        <p>
            I encourage you to zoom into the image. You can really see the difference. I would make the image bigger,
            but
            I don't want to mess with my page layout even more than I already have with the current size of this image.
