                <h3>
                    Why this dependency is necessary
                </h3>
                <p>
                    My character is an activist, so she needs to act. Therefore, I created a protest/movement for her
                    relating to her job as a florist – The Purple Flower Protest. This links her two defining
                    characteristics: anti-apartheid activist and florist. To encourage others to participate and
                    interact with this movement, I created a Twitter account and a hashtag, to connect all those who are
                    part of the movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, I believe this activity should be integrated into her site, to encourage more people to
                    partake. Not only can viewers of her site be linked to her Twitter account from a basic hyperlink,
                    but they can view randomly chosen Tweets with the #PurpleFLowerProtest89 from other accounts
                    directly on her site. This allows like-minded people to connect. This also encourages viewers to
                    Tweet their participation in the protest in hopes of being displayed on this website and therefore
                    getting more connections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, I believe it is necessary to include a dependency that allows people to interact and
                    display their protesting. As such, I chose to embed Tweets into the website. First of all, this
                    looks more professional and is more intuitive, in terms of clicking on the Tweet and being taken to
                    that user’s account. Additionally, I store various Tweets from different accounts to randomly
                    display. This is better than just embedding my character’s timeline, again since this improves
                    people’s connections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I believe the idea of Tweeting about the protest also shows the size of the protest,
                    it shows which South Africans are participating, it is an opportunity to explore South Africa to
                    fins where these flowers have been planted. It allows other florist to promote their local stores or
                    nursery in comradery with the protests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obviously, since this is a made-up protest, these Tweets do not exist, but I believe this would have
                    been the result of a protest like this with access to technology like this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, randomly generating a Tweet makes the site less static and encourages viewers to come back
                    to the site to see another Tweet.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    What are the alternatives and why didn’t I use them?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Again, I wanted the external dependency to push the protest on Twitter/interaction with like-minded
                    people. As such, there were two other alternatives to what I did.
                </p>
                <ol style="padding-left: 6%;">
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Embed my character’s profile timeline [2]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This uses the same embedding idea as the individual Tweets. However, it did not offer much
                            creatively like choosing from many individual Tweets, and it took up too much of the site
                            unnecessarily. Also, I would not have implemented as advanced code with it.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Twitter Search API [3]
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using the Standard API, a user to search for an array of recent Tweets or most popular
                            Tweets within the last 7 days [3]. The Standard API is free [3], which is why it is
                            desirable. This would create the same effect as my chosen dependency, but it is more
                            advanced and maintainable since the Tweets are not manually stored. However, this requires
                            the Twitter Account to be a developer account since “all new developers must apply for a
                            developer account to access Twitter APIs” [4] and I did not receive approval for my
                            application for a developer account in time to work with this dependency. There is not
                            enough information available to make one aware that you need a developer account; there is
                            are a lot of resources about using this API, many of which explicitly state you need to be a
                            developer.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Why I chose this one</h3>
                <p>
                    As I have mentioned above, I wanted to encourage interaction with the protest. Either of these
                    dependencies would have worked but I chose this one since I was able to actually integrate it with
                    my site since I did not need a developer account to do so and was able to be more creative with its
                    use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This dependency was also easy to use since Twitter has allowed for embedding easily directly from a
                    Tweet [1] and as such I was able to store the Tweets as desired. Again, the Twitter widget allowed
                    for a more professional look which I liked on my site.
                </p>
                <h3>The technical impact of it on my site</h3>
                <p>
                    I store the embedded Tweet code in an array. The JavaScript code randomly generates a number (from
                    the number of items in the array) and uses this number to generate the specific Tweet on the site.
                    The Twitter widget script is connected on the protest page. This was simple to design and allows for
                    a more dynamic site. The JavaScript is meaningful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, due to the Tweets being manually store, potential errors can arise if a Tweet is deleted.
                    As such, constant updates and maintenance is needed here.
                </p>
