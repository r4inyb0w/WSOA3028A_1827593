            The system described in this article can be compared to GitHub. This article discusses storing only the changes made to a document and having access to previous versions of a document. GitHub makes use of version control which does this. Furthermore, GitHub allows for collaboration. This article discusses public and private access to information, and in GitHub’s case, projects can be accessed by multiple people if required or can be kept private.<br>

            Ted Nelson proposed that information can be stored in a more efficient way. Instead of saving entire versions of a literature, only the changes will be saved, continuously. This allows users access to all versions of a literature; users can navigate the literature through space and time. They can see a timeline of the changes made to the literature, another similarity to GitHub. Further, the literature can link to other data to be used. Again, these links allow information to only be stored in one space, therefore saving storage space, but allow access from another document. This again relates to collaboration offered on GitHub, the actual main document is only stored physically in one place but can be accessed and edited from other computers. A document will hold all literature, data and links. Additionally, the idea of windowing between documents is explored. One document can link to another document through a window. The navigation of documents is stacked, so a user can return to previous parts of the document if necessary. Documents are linked by character, not address. Therefore, if the position of relative information changes, the link will still work. There can be multiple links between documents. This idea isn’t limited to text, it can be used in photos, music etc. A network is thus created between all these documents. Comparable to an internet with better storage capabilities. This information can continuously be revisited and updated.
