            Metadata

            <p>Metadata is “data about data”. Alternatively, it can be described as a summary of the data. Metadata can
                be
                used for tags, dates, information about content contributors and access rights. For example, a photo can
                include metadata such as the date and time it was taken and its filename.</p>

            <p>Metadata helps to group similar data and helps to organise data. Ontologies such as classes, instances,
                properties and functions are used to define relationships between things. It is easier to add metadata
                to
                similar datasets when ontologies are employed. This improves discoverability of data.</p>

            <p>Metadata is important to use since it will give data context and, thus, the quality of this data is
                improved
                since its origin is known.</p>

            <p>Metadata in HTML is placed between the head tags. Information in this tag is not displayed on the
                website.
                The meta tag is used to store the metadata about the website. This metadata is used by web crawlers and
                browsers and improves the websites search engine ranking. Some information stored in these meta tags
                could
                include a description of the page, information about the page creator and instructions to browsers.
                Combining the meta element with other attributes creates “document-level” metadata. For example, within
                the
                meta element, one could have: name = “abc” content = “xyz”. To give instructions to the browsers, the
                “http-equiv” attribute is used within meta tags. For example, an instruction can direct the browser to
                refresh the page every few minutes. The character set is also written within the meta tag. This
                establishes
                the character encoding of the page.</p>
