            <article>
                <p>Both short stories emphasise how limitless and incomprehensible the universe is.</p>

                <p>The Library of Babel concludes that the universe is “unlimited yet periodic”, meaning that
                    there is a
                    vast
                    amount of information but at some point, that information is repeated exactly as it was
                    before. It
                    describes
                    man’s search for the ultimate truths, about their lives, their deaths and how it was all
                    created.
                    But
                    this
                    information is unattainable, and even if we were to learn it, it is above our understanding.
                    The
                    loss of
                    knowledge which is directly in front of you.</p>

                <p>The Garden of Forking Paths discusses various timelines in which everything is possible.
                    Every
                    decision
                    or
                    event
                    changes the course of time in infinite ways, but all of these are true, hence the timeline
                    “forks”.
                    Again, a
                    loss of knowledge, knowledge of alternate realities and what ifs.</p>

                <p>I can relate this idea of expanse information and possibility to something more
                    comprehensible, the
                    internet.
                    Everything one can think of can be found in the internet, and as we learn more, so the
                    internet will
                    grow.
                    All
                    the information we know whether it is true or not and whether we can understand it or not,
                    can, for
                    the
                    most
                    part, be found on the internet. Like the storage of information in the Library of Babel,
                    perhaps
                    sans
                    the
                    divine
                    truths of the universe. Searching the internet can take one down many different paths of
                    information,
                    many
                    paths
                    conflicting fully or partially, like the forking paths of reality in The Garden of Forking
                    Paths.
                    All
                    paths
                    exist and are true, and they exist all at once. The path of information you take is due to
                    your
                    choices.
                    We
                    live
                    with all this information at our fingertips, but we can never know it all, our loss of
                    knowledge.
