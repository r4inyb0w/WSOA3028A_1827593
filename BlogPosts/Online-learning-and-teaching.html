            <p>If we put the issues with accessibility aside, there are many options for online learning.</p>

            <p>Firstly, physical content such as notes and presentations can be posted to, for example, Google Drive,
                Dropbox, Sakai (for the University of the Witwatersrand) or even emailed directly to the students.
                Additionally, communication with lecturers can be conducted over email. Actual lectures can be recorded
                and uploaded to the applications mentioned above, or even on to YouTube. In my experience, our
                first-year maths lectures were recorded and uploaded to Panopto and our Data Structure lecturer would
                upload example exercises to his YouTube channel. With screen recording technology, this is made easier.
                This content was easy to understand through the screen. Immediate interaction can take place using
                telecommunications applications such as Skype, Slack, Zoom and even Discord. Discussions amongst
                students can
                take place on discussion boards or group chats on WhatsApp, for example. If students set up specific
                times to host these discussions, students are able to engage nicely.</p>

            <p>However, to access all this information students need access to some sort of computing device, such as a
                computer or smartphone, and they need access to data, both of which can be expensive. As Digital Arts
                students, we are lucky to have our own PCs and have Wi-Fi access at our university. However, in the case
                that learning is fully online, i.e. no access to campus and hence no access to campus Wi-Fi, we too can
                be at a disadvantage in terms of data access.
            </p>

            <p>In discussion with my peers, it seems that many of them have access to data and this is something we tend
                to take for granted. During load-shedding, our Wi-Fi is down, and it is such a struggle to get
                meaningful work done without this access to data. If we had absolutely no access to data, it would be
                impossible to get any work done. We would not be able to receive content nor would we be able to
                research, submit content and get feedback.</p>

            <p>Now imagine if a student does not have access to any of this technology. How can they be expected to
                successful study online?</p>

            <p>The ethical implications of online teaching and learning directly disadvantage those who do not have
                access to data or technology. These students are usually already at a disadvantage and preventing access
                to education prevents them from progressing and potentially moving out of their current situation. This
                system of enforced online learning helps those who are already in a relatively comfortable position. As
                the saying goes, “the rich get richer and the poor stay poor”.
            </p>

            <p>So how can we deal with this situation. In the case that a university enforces online learning, it would
                likely be for a good reason, such as a virus outbreak. It would not be ethical, in terms of protecting
                peoples’ health, to continue with in-person classes, however, as we’ve seen it is not ethical to expect
                students to participate in online learning. Some of the following ideas might seem less efficient than
                online learning but this access to education for students who need alternative methods, even in a
                limited capacity, is better than no access at all.</p>

            <p>My first idea when brought this topic was to use radio. Again, maybe not everyone has access to a radio,
                but I believe they are easier and more cost-friendly to obtain. Producing the content is the duty of the
                lecturer and students can just tune into the correct radio station to listen to the lecture. However, as
                expected, nothing is free. If there is the budget for it, there are many resources explaining how one
                can transmit over a radio frequency, and if the lecturer has data access, there are also different
                websites that streamline the process for you, like Radio.co. Obviously not all lectures can be done via
                radio. I would expect that theoretical-based lectures, with a larger number of students, could make use
                of this method, such as first-year psychology.</p>

            <p>Students could potentially communicate with each using Walkie-Talkies, which can reach up to 32 km.
                Again, these devices are expensive, but maybe if they were provided to the students it could be a
                slightly more feasible way to communicate. We must remember that not all students have cell phones.</p>

            <p>For students with access to computers and limited data, lecturers could make use of audio podcasts which
                require minimal data to listen to, approximately 60MB per hour.</p>

            <p>In a world where all students and staff have personal access to computers and data, I believe online
                learning can be conducted successfully. However, until this access is granted, or more viable ways of
                remote learning are introduced, online learning hugely disadvantages those without access.</p>
