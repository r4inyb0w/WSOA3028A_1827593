        Why the dot-com bubble was an important part of internet history?
    </h2>
    <article style="padding-left: 18%; padding-right: 45%; text-align: justify;">
        The dot com bubble involved investors pouring money into internet companies in the hope that they would turn
        great profit. This in turn grew the “stock equity valuations” of technology and the internet. Many companies and
        IPOs (initial public offerings) arose in this period. Stocks soared but profits minimal, mostly losses. But
        these companies did not care. They wanted the “valuation of an internet company”. And then the bubble popped.
        Companies such as Priceline, a huge company in the dot com era, dropped 94% in stocks. However, it was your
        average investor that lost out.<br>
        <br>
        The dot com crash provides a valuable lesson for those in internet businesses. These dot com companies were
        chasing valuation and not profit. They wanted to “Get Big Fast”. However, as the crash showed, this was
        unsustainable and resulted in trillions of dollars being lost. This, of course, affected the economy. And so,
        came the dot-com recession.<br>
        <br>
        Even though the dot-com bubble crash significantly affected the economic, social and political sectors; it did
        allow for the internet to further develop. Due to the investments made in these dot-com companies and start-ups,
        the digital infrastructure was laid down, particularly fiber. This allowed for cheaper bandwidth and large
        unused broadband capacity. This would allow new applications to be cheaply distributed when the time came.<br>
        <br>
        Not only do we have the technology and infrastructure left over from this era, but we have learnt from it. It is
        important to experience failure to push us to develop in a better direction. The usage of the internet has grown
        significantly since 2000 and we use what we learnt from the dot com era in our online presence today.<br>
