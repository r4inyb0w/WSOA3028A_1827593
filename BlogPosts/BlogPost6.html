            <p>The dot com bubble involved investors pouring money into internet companies in the hope that they would
                turn
                great profit. This in turn grew the “stock equity valuations” of technology and the internet. Many
                companies
                and
                IPOs (initial public offerings) arose in this period. Stocks soared but profits minimal, mostly losses.
                But
                these companies did not care. They wanted the “valuation of an internet company”. And then the bubble
                popped.
                Companies such as Priceline, a huge company in the dot com era, dropped 94% in stocks. However, it was
                your
                average investor that lost out.</p>
            <p>The dot com crash provides a valuable lesson for those in internet businesses. These dot com companies
                were
                chasing valuation and not profit. They wanted to “Get Big Fast”. However, as the crash showed, this was
                unsustainable and resulted in trillions of dollars being lost. This, of course, affected the economy.
                And
                so,
                came the dot-com recession.</p>
            <p>Even though the dot-com bubble crash significantly affected the economic, social and political sectors;
                it
                did
                allow for the internet to further develop. Due to the investments made in these dot-com companies and
                start-ups,
                the digital infrastructure was laid down, particularly fiber. This allowed for cheaper bandwidth and
                large
                unused broadband capacity. This would allow new applications to be cheaply distributed when the time
                came.</p>
            <p>Not only do we have the technology and infrastructure left over from this era, but we have learnt from
                it.
                It is
                important to experience failure to push us to develop in a better direction. The usage of the internet
                has
                grown
                significantly since 2000 and we use what we learnt from the dot com era in our online presence today.
