                Response: Making a Feminist Internet (Magenya, 2020)
            </h2>
            <time datetime=" 2020/06/19">Friday, 19 June</time>
            <article>
                <p>“We need even more African feminists and feminisms on, in, around the internet.”</p>
                <p>
                    This article discusses the crucial need for African feminists to tell their stories and share their
                    point of view to improve inclusivity and truth of experience on the internet. It is important to
                    provide accurate information about the experiences of African women, those of the LGBTQIA community
                    and people with disabilities. Additionally, there is a lack of resources on body-positivity and
                    sexuality. This article makes a great point that producing this content, like fashion for fat women
                    and make-up for boys, “is resistance made visible.” Magenya says “the same kind of kindness and
                    care that we move in the world with when trying to understand the various problems that we live
                    with, is needed online”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, this article describes the internet as a “safe-space” for gender-based violence.
                    Legislations that protect against theses attacks is “largely absent in many African countries”. As
                    such, the reason African feminists on the internet is so necessary, is because we are in danger of
                    the internet reflecting the unequal physical world we live in and this is due to unequal access and
                    contribution to the internet. Magenya says the internet is “replicating existing oppression and
                    suppression.” An example of discrimination against women over the internet, from mine and my
                    friends'
                    is experience, is in the online gaming community. It is a resource we turn to for entertainment and
                    interaction, more so during lockdown, and we should be allowed to feel safe and enjoy ourselves.
                    However, we often experience sexual harassment and sexist remarks from boys or men who feel
                    safe to do so.

                    Furthermore, innovators in Africa resort to designing technology to improve lives in Africa, for
                    example, to save people from drought and disease. It is not innovation for fun. So, Africans use
                    their resources and skills to largely fix the problems caused by the Western world taking advantage
                    of the continent, its people and resources. One such example is the pharmaceutical company, Pfizer,
                    illegally testing anti-meningitis drugs on children. It is clear that Africans are restricted in
                    their innovation opportunities because they are using their access to technology to improve lives.

                    This relates to one of my previous blog posts, <a class="main" href="Information-Geographies.html">A
                        close
                        reading: Towards a study of information
                        geographies</a>, which discusses the lack of content about Africa being produced in Africa. In
                    general,
                    this is true, but this article further shows information about women, the LGBTQIA community and
                    people with disabilities in Africa, is produced on an even lesser scale by the right people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, the push to get this fair content on the internet, by projects such as "All Women
                    Count - Take Back The Tech!" is prevalent to start equalising the content and contributors on the
                    internet, especially in the time of Covid-19 when people are turning to the internet to communicate
                    and have company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mangenya concludes with this, which I believe sums up this issue perfectly and I couldn’t put it
                    better myself: “Without a feminist internet that ensures that all people can access and influence
                    content and governance of this internet, we will be replicating a violent and oppressive way of life
                    that might eventually be inescapable.”
