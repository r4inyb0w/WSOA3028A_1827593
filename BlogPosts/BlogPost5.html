            <p>The system described in this article can be compared to GitHub. This article discusses storing only the
                changes
                made to a document and having access to previous versions of a document. GitHub makes use of version
                control
                which does this. Furthermore, GitHub allows for collaboration. This article discusses public and private
                access
                to information, and in GitHub’s case, projects can be accessed by multiple people if required or can be
                kept
                private.</p>

            <p>Ted Nelson proposed that information can be stored in a more efficient way. Instead of saving entire
                versions of
                a literature, only the changes will be saved, continuously. This allows users access to all versions of
                a
                literature; users can navigate the literature through space and time. They can see a timeline of the
                changes
                made to the literature, another similarity to GitHub. Further, the literature can link to other data to
                be
                used.
                Again, these links allow information to only be stored in one space, therefore saving storage space, but
                allow
                access from another document. This again relates to collaboration offered on GitHub, the actual main
                document is
                only stored physically in one place but can be accessed and edited from other computers. A document will
                hold
                all literature, data and links. Additionally, the idea of windowing between documents is explored. One
                document
                can link to another document through a window. The navigation of documents is stacked, so a user can
                return
                to
                previous parts of the document if necessary. Documents are linked by character, not address. Therefore,
                if
                the
                position of relative information changes, the link will still work. There can be multiple links between
                documents. This idea isn’t limited to text, it can be used in photos, music etc. A network is thus
                created
                between all these documents. Comparable to an internet with better storage capabilities. This
                information
                can
                continuously be revisited and updated.</p>
