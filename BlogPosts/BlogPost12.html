            <p>My character is a florist and displays different flower arrangements on her website. </p>

            <p>Firstly, Macey Daniels’ favorite flower is the blue iris since it represents hope. Hope for a better
                future, where all people are treated equally and with respect. Hope for her country, hope for her peers
                to be better and treat people better, hope for all those fighting to come home safely, hope for justice.
                Additionally, irises can also symbolize faith, wisdom, courage, and admiration, traits that Macey
                values. Her family home is often filled with irises as her family also understand their meaning and use
                them as a daily reminder to have faith in themselves, hope for their country’s future, to have the
                courage to stand for what they believe in, be wise in their choice of company, and admire those fighting
                for freedom. The iris is used in many of the Daniels' Daisies’ bouquets.</p>

            <p>Tulips symbolize, in general, love. Red tulips represent true love; pink tulips represent caring and well
                wishes. Yellow are for cheer, purple for royalty and elegance, white for condolences.</p>

            <p>Macey Daniels’ favorite floral arrangement, which is directly linked to from her homepage, is, what she
                has donned “Good Wishes”. This bouquet is made up of blue irises and red and pink tulips. This flower
                arrangement says: I wish for you love, care and to never let go of your hope.</p>

            <p>Of course, they sell the flower of their namesake. Daisies symbolize innocence and purity. In Norse
                mythology, the daisy is related to Freya, the goddess of fertility, and so daisies can also symbolize
                motherhood. Daniels’ Daisies does have a nice alliteration, but if you explore the deeper meaning, the
                shop’s name shows that this is a family business, passed down from mother to daughter; it is a
                celebration of motherhood. Daisies are commonly sold in flower arrangements or simple bouquets in their
                florist. Daisies were also, of course, the flowers Macey’s mother gifted to her on her first day on the
                job.</p>
