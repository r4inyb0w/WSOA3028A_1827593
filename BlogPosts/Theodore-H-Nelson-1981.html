            <article>
                <p>The system described in this article can be compared to GitHub. This article discusses storing only
                    the
                    changes
                    made to a document and having access to previous versions of a document. GitHub makes use of version
                    control
                    which does this. Furthermore, GitHub allows for collaboration. This article discusses public and
                    private
                    access
                    to information, and in GitHub’s case, projects can be accessed by multiple people if required or can
                    be
                    kept
                    private.</p>

                <p>Ted Nelson proposed that information can be stored in a more efficient way. Instead of saving entire
                    versions of
                    a literature, only the changes will be saved, continuously. This allows users access to all versions
                    of
                    a
                    literature; users can navigate the literature through space and time. They can see a timeline of the
                    changes
                    made to the literature, another similarity to GitHub. Further, the literature can link to other data
                    to
                    be
                    used.
                    Again, these links allow information to only be stored in one space, therefore saving storage space,
                    but
                    allow
                    access from another document. This again relates to collaboration offered on GitHub, the actual main
                    document is
                    only stored physically in one place but can be accessed and edited from other computers. A document
                    will
                    hold
                    all literature, data and links. Additionally, the idea of windowing between documents is explored.
                    One
                    document
                    can link to another document through a window. The navigation of documents is stacked, so a user can
                    return
                    to
                    previous parts of the document if necessary. Documents are linked by character, not address.
                    Therefore,
                    if
                    the
                    position of relative information changes, the link will still work. There can be multiple links
                    between
                    documents. This idea isn’t limited to text, it can be used in photos, music etc. A network is thus
                    created
                    between all these documents. Comparable to an internet with better storage capabilities. This
                    information
                    can
                    continuously be revisited and updated.</p>
