            A close reading: Towards a study of information geographies [1]
        </h2>
        <section class="blogs">
            <time datetime="2020/05/01">Friday, 1 May</time>
            <p>
                This paper centres around the uneven distribution of access and production of content between the global
                North and the global South. The global North contributes overwhelmingly to the contents and information
                presented on the web as well as provides greater access opportunities for people in this region. This
                paper suggests that “most of Africa is being left in a technological apartheid” [1].
            </p>
            <p>
                However, Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Lessig points out that this technology (the web) will be able to
                “equalize the opportunity that people have to access and participate in the construction of knowledge
                and culture, regardless of geographic placing” [1], meaning that this technology should enable equal
                contributions to knowledge from all over the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                This study aimed to answer the following questions, with regards to the new opportunities provided by
                the web. The following questions are taken directly from the paper [1]:</p>
            <p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 5%;">
                <li>How has this (connectivity through the global network) altered the political economy or geographies
                    of information?</li>
                <li>Has the proliferation of access altered participation or representation? </li>
                <li>Are changing socio-technical systems … changing information geographies? </li>
                <li>[Since] people can in theory create and access information about and from almost anywhere on
                    earth, are we seeing different geographies of participation and representation or new layers of
                    digital augmentations that are associated with places? </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                This study was broken up into three distinct categories. Geographies of access enablement discusses who
                has access and as such who is able to participate and be represented. Geographies of participation
                discusses where this information is generated. Finally, geographies of representation discusses who this
                information is created for and created by (and consequently who this information is not created for or
                not created by).
            </p>
            <h3>Geographies of access enablement</h3>
            <p>
                The results showed that the majority of the internet population actually derives from China with the
                United States, India and Japan following closely. Interestingly, broadband affordability contributes
                largely to this distribution of access. For example, in Europe and North America, to access sufficient
                broadband one would only need to work a couple of hours per month; this shows the rate of cost of
                broadband in these regions is low. However, in Africa one would need to spend between 10% to 250% of
                their average income per month to obtain similar broadband access. Therefore, it is clear that there is
                uneven access between the global North and the global South since it is more cost effective for
                Europeans and North Americans to access sufficient broadband.
            </p>
            <h3>Geography is a participation</h3>
            <p>
                This category focused on three areas, namely: domain names, GitHub users and Wikipedia edits.
            </p>
            <h4>Domain names</h4>
            <p>
                The results of this particular study determined that 78% of domain names are registered in
                Europe and North America. It further concludes that the number of Internet users does not directly
                relate to the number of domain names registered to that country or place. For example, a country with a
                large percentage of internet users will not necessarily have a large number of domain names. And
                finally, the results show that Western Europe and North America produce digital content more than
                anywhere else in the world. This further proves the statement that the global North contributes
                overwhelmingly to web content compared to the global South.
            </p>
            <h4>GitHub users</h4>
            <p>
                Considering GitHub is used for collaboration, sharing of code and building of websites,
                those with access to this platform are more likely contributing to global software development. As such,
                the fact that North America and Europe, again, contribute overwhelmingly to this platform compared to
                the rest of the world (especially Africa and the Middle East) shows that they contribute more to this
                development. This suggests that the global South remain further behind in software development.
                Additionally, the limited number of people contributing to this platform from Africa and the Middle East
                is surprisingly low compared to the number of Internet users of these regions. So, since the number of
                Internet users in these regions is already less than that of the global North, this means even less
                users are contributing to the GitHub platform. This clearly shows a limited contribution from the global
                South.
            </p>
            <h4>Wikipedia</h4>
            <p>
                The most interesting discovery from this study showed who provides information about a
                country. The majority of the information written about the United States and the United Kingdom comes
                from users of these regions, however, less than 5% of the content written about Africa is generated
                locally. This means that more information is written about Africa from people who do not live in Africa
                and as such we must ask whether this information can be trusted. Additionally, if information is written
                about a country locally, as it is in the United States and the United Kingdom, how can we trust that
                this information is not biased towards these locations. Therefore, the reliability of information about
                different geographic locations is questionable. In particular, the lack of locally produced information
                about Africa may explain why, for instance, Americans tend to have a warped perception of Africa.
                According to John Zimmerman from The New Republic, “overall ignorance of the real Africa … allows mass
                media to substitute a mythical one” [2]. This “mythical Africa” describes Africa as one single entity,
                rather than many diverse countries, and reinforces the idea that Africa is a dangerous and miserable
                place comprised solely of animal life and the wilderness [2].
            </p>
            <h3>Geographies of representation</h3>
            <p>
                This category focused on Google searches, OpenStreetMap and the Semantic Web defined by Geonames and
                Freebase. The Google searches results showed that the amount of content written about the United States
                of America far exceeds that of countries in the global South. China, Japan and the UK were the next most
                written about countries on the web. Freebase shows that the United States had 45% of the place names in
                their database. This is an overwhelming statistic considering the United States only consists of 5% of
                the global population and 10% of Internet users. However, the Geonames database showed that the United
                States only consists of 25% of the place names in their database; this is still greater than the
                percentage of database content about the entirety of Asia. Asia consists of 23% of this database content
                and Europe consists of 19% of this database content - one country had more information than two entire
                continents. This clearly shows that the United States of America dominates the content on the web with
                regards to information on the country or location itself. This further proves the power of the global
                North.
            </p>
            <h3>Critical reflection </h3>
            <p>
                This study clearly shows the uneven contribution of content between the global North and the global
                South. Considering the global North has easier access to the web in general shows that the global North
                will be responsible for the majority of the content produced on the web. A current example of this
                uneven contribution of information is the current Black Lives Matter movement. In South Africa, we have
                access to all the information about the current protests against police brutality in the United States.
                We see their videos, their news reports, their images, their Tweets and their political displays. From a
                social media standpoint, my current feeds are populated almost exclusively with the Black Lives Matter
                movement in America. This is a clear example of how the global North, in particular North America,
                monopolises the spread of information on the web. Of course, this information is also prevalent on news
                reports from news stations such as CNN. In the midst of a global pandemic, we are still focused on a
                major movement in the United States. Of course, this movement is crucial and should be supported,
                however, it is interesting that we as South Africans are gaining so much information about the issues
                with American police brutality rather than information about police brutality in South Africa.
                Currently, it is more difficult to find information on police brutality in South Africa even though we
                are in South Africa. Furthermore, many countries such as England and Australia have participated in
                marches for the Black Lives Matter movement in America to show their solidarity. Again, it is
                interesting to see how much of an influence American culture and political movements have on the rest of
                the world. I support these protests - it is amazing to see how the world can come together to fight
                against police brutality in America and fight for black lives in America. Many of these marches are also
                in support of change in their respective countries but, crucially, this movement started because of
                America’s influence. Therefore, this shows how America in particular contributes overwhelmingly to the
                spread of information and content on the Internet, and in general through news reports. It would be
                interesting to study the contributions of information through social media considering how many people
                use social media to access information and to share content. For example, I have gained most of my
                knowledge about the current Black Lives Matter movement in America from social media. I have also gained
                knowledge about similar issues in South Africa through the use of social media, but I wonder if any of
                this information about Africa is reaching other countries. As such, I believe future research should be
                conducted on the use of social media to expand on this study.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, research should be conducted to understand what causes these uneven information
                geographies. Web censorship in different countries should be evaluated to determine how this could
                affect global information geographies. Another question to consider is how the difference between gender
                and class, for example, may affect information contribution. Finally, it is imperative to research how
                these inequalities can be corrected: what needs to be done to even the playing field of information
                contribution between the global north and the global South? Is this something that can ever be achieved?
                Can the global South ever catch up to the global North?
