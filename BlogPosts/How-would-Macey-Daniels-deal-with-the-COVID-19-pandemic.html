        <time datetime=" 2020/03/27">Friday, 27 March</time>
        <article>
            <p>I’m writing this post on 26 March 2020. At midnight South Africa will go into lockdown for the next 21
                days (update: 35 days). I’m going to explore how I think my character (as she is, i.e. at 22 years of
                age, running a
                florist) would react to this pandemic, how it would affect her and how she would spend her time.</p>

            <p>Macey Daniels is a strong willed, level-headed woman. I think she would listen intently to all the news
                reports, follow the instructions from the government very seriously and listen to research and
                doctors. She would want to ensure her parents and family and friends are aware of the situation and are
                following the appropriate procedures. She would be very concerned for her parent’s health and safety.
                She would be quarantined with her parents at their family home, she would insist her parents stay home
                and she would be responsible for shopping and the like. She would wear gloves in public, make short
                trips and come home and thoroughly wash her hands, clean the products she has bought and change clothes.
                She would rather over-react than underreact.</p>

            <p>She runs a florist; this is a contact business. Obviously when the lockdown is initiated, she would have
                to shut down. However, she is a caring person, she would have sent her additional staff home when the
                schools were shut down and would have continued to run the business as best as she could alone. She
                would
                allow for only online orders, limited to the products she had since she wouldn’t want to go out to the
                large markets to get new produce, and would deliver the flowers to the customers using her original
                delivery system. I’m guessing her staff would have some sort of unemployment plan in which they would
                still receive a salary at this time. However, when the lockdown is initiated, the florist wouldn’t make
                any money and so all the staff, including Macey, would not get income. I’m sure she would make use of
                the
                government grants.
            </p>

            <p>Being a family-oriented person, staying with her family would be a great experience for her. They are all
                creative so they would play boardgames, do crafts and build models together. The best way they would
                spend
                their time is gardening. Of course, her and her mom would plant and tend to the flowers in their garden.
                They would plant pansies, petunias, violas, foxgloves and primulas. These are winter plants that should
                be planted in the autumn. Additionally, they would continue to nurture the vegetable garden they are
                likely to
                have, adding additional seeds. This would decrease the money they would need to spend at the grocery
                store. They
                would plant peas, spinach and green pepper, which flourish in the wintertime. Her parents and her would
                have weekly movie nights.</p>

            <p>Macey would encourage a positive outlook on the situation and appreciate the time she gets to spend with
                her family. She would pray for those who are not in as privileged a position as she is. She would
                check in on her friends and family daily. She would try keep herself as busy as possible.</p>
