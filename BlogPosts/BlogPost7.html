        The link between changing technology and the development and spread of internet culture
    </h2>
    <article style="padding-left: 18%; padding-right: 45%; text-align: justify;">
        The change from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 must have influenced internet culture. <br>
        <br>
        Web 1.0 can be described as displaying static websites, tending to be particularly informational and with
        limited interactions. Users’ comments were stored in “Guestbooks” and not displayed on the actual content page
        [1]. <br>
        <br>
        Web 2.0 provides a much more interactive system, with the growth of social media and user generated content like
        comments [1]. Further, Web 2.0 included more dynamic content with more user input [2]. <br>
        <br>
        Web 3.0 can be defined as the semantic web, understanding the meaning of words to improve users’ connection to
        content [2]. Further, there is more ubiquity. Therefore, more information can be more easily accessed.
        Additionally, Web 3.0 includes the use of artificial intelligence [2].<br>
        <br>
        Since the ability to connect to information and the growth of user generated content has increased throughout
        the development of the web, it follows that internet culture has grown along with it. Internet users can easily
        consume, share and create content in the current stage of the web. Therefore, it makes sense that, for example,
        memes have become so integrated into our lives and the amount of meme content has grown impressively since
        earlier iterations of the web. As seen in the YouTube video “History of Memes – Through the Years” [3], the
        number of memes produced in the last few years are much greater than those produced in the early 2000s. Further,
        this video shows how intertwined internet culture has become within itself. Some of these videos, if shown to
        someone who was not engrossed in internet culture, would make no sense. Due to the nature of sharing content, in
        which content is shared across many different websites like Instagram, Twitter, Reddit etc, and in which content
        can be shared so quickly, memes change and develop very quickly. Amalgamations of memes then become the new
        meme. We, those part of internet culture, are consuming this content so quickly that we resort to this
        amalgamation. According to research done by a student from the University of Pretoria [4], memes have
        characteristics including longevity, variation and heredity. Further, she concludes that the internet is the
        perfect place to show case memes and states that social media has further elevated the sharing of memes [4].
        Therefore, showing how the development from Web 1.0 to 2.0 has influenced the spread of memes. <br>
        <br>
        Additionally, the spread of fake news has increased since the development of Web 2.0, the spread of fake news is
        most effective over social media, and Web 3.0 due to AI [5]. Both humans and bots are propagating this fake news
        [5]. Web 2.0 allowed humans to spread fake news more easily over social media and Web 3.0 allowed bots to target
        and spread fake news to receptive audiences.<br>
