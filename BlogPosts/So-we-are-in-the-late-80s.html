                So we are in the late 80s?
            </h2>

            <article>
                <p>This website is how I imagine a “modern web” would be used in the late 80s if they had access to the
                    same
                    technologies we do. I believe information that was kept from South Africans would be easier to
                    access
                    with this web. Additionally, they would be able to access information from other countries that
                    would
                    otherwise be prohibited. For example, anti-apartheid rallies and movements in Britain, like the AAM
                    or
                    Boycott Movement [1] would not have been shown to South Africans in that time, however with this
                    technology I believe this information could have been accessed, even if South Africa had limited
                    their
                    citizens’ access. We know that China has heavy internet censorship, reportedly 18 000 websites are
                    blocked [2], however it is suggested that citizens still find ways to access this blocked
                    information.
                    This is apparently done through the use of VPNs or changing IP addresses [2]. I believe if this was
                    the
                    case during the Apartheid era, activists would find a way to access this information.</p>
                <h3>Why did I choose this timeframe?</h3>
                <p>Since my parents were in their 20s in the 80s, I felt like I could attain information from a primary
                    source, which would make my site more believable. The late 80s also includes the Purple March. Since
                    my
                    character is a florist and a creative person, I felt linking her activism to events characterized by
                    colours opened the doors to display her creativity.</p>
                <h3>Why did I choose this character?</h3>
                <p>I am a girl.</p>
                <p>I am in university.</p>
                <p>I am in my 20s.</p>
                <p>Macey Daniels is a reflection of myself. It’s easier to develop a character that I can relate to. She
                    is
                    also someone I aspire to be like. She runs a business, she is family oriented and she sticks to her
                    beliefs.
                </p>
                <p>I also thought if I wanted to write about an activist, I would want to write about her in a
                    significant
                    context. Not to say that activism isn’t relevant all the time, but I thought using one of the
                    biggest
                    historical tragedies of South Africa would be more understandable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I could have set this character in modern times and have her discuss the issues we as South Africans
                    are
                    facing now, however it was more of challenge for me to write about an earlier time since I needed to
                    do
                    more research and determine what information was around in that time and how internet access and
                    these
                    modern technologies would have influenced her and her way of thinking.
