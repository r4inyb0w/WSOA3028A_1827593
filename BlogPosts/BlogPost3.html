            <p>Macey Daniels is a 22-year-old florist living in the late 80s in Johannesburg, South Africa. She comes
                from
                a
                strongly opinionated and supportive family. Herself and her family are greatly anti-apartheid and have
                all,
                at
                one time or another, been arrested for it. Macey studied business at university and has taken over her
                mom’s
                florist shop. She loves flowers and their meanings and often posts new arrangements on her profile. She
                likes
                the “brown paper packaging tied up with string” aesthetic, the florist is designed around this. Light
                pink walls, lots of plants and woven pots line the walls and windowsills. She is seen as quite feminine
                and elegant.
                However, Macey
                is
                also a talented graffiti artist. Her dad would let her help him spray-paint the models he would build
                for
                work.
                She’s always loved this medium for artistic expression. Now she uses her spray-painting skills to
                protest. This alternative expression can be quite surprising to those who know her as the sweet florist.
                Imagine her as that brown paper package tied up with string, signed with a black marker.
                She
                graffities political slogans on public buildings. This has led to the aforementioned arrests, but she
                will
                not
                give up her small part in this fight. She likes to post about this street art and other anti-apartheid
                things on
                her profile as well, spreading the message. She is strong-willed and confident. She is creative and
                sentimental.</p>
