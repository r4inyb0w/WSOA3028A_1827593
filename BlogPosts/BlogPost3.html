            Macey Daniels is a 22-year-old florist living in the late 80s in Johannesburg, South Africa. She comes from a strongly opinionated and supportive family. Herself and her family are greatly anti-apartheid and have all, at one time or another, been arrested for it. Macey studied business at university and has taken over her mom’s florist shop. She loves flowers and their meanings and often posts new arrangements on her profile. She likes the “brown paper packaging tied up with string” aesthetic. She is seen as quite feminine and elegant. Macey is also a talented graffiti artist. Her dad would let her help him spray-paint the models he would build for work. She’s always loved this medium for artistic expression. Now she uses her spray-painting skills to protest. She graffities political slogans on public buildings. This has led to the aforementioned arrests, but she will not give up her small part in this fight. She likes to post about this street art and other anti-apartheid things on her profile as well, spreading the message. She is strong-willed and confident. She is creative and sentimental.
