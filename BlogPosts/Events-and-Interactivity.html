            <p>What is an event?</p>
            <p>In terms of an Information Technology structure, an event is any action that is detected by the program,
                usually asynchronously, from the external environment. Applications that are “event-driven” respond to
                events. For example, a user clicking a button is an event; a hardware timer can be an event. The use of
                events allows the system to be interactive.</p>

            <p>What is interactivity?</p>
            <p>Interactivity is defined by its context. There are many definitions for interactivity. Some examples
                include, Lev Manovich, who believes anything represented in a computer is automatically interactive.
                Aaron
                Smuts defines interactivity as something that is responsive, does not completely control nor is
                completely
                controlled, and is not random. Espen Aarseth rather uses the word ergodic over interactivity. Ergodic
                means
                “to work”. Further, Aarseth explains in ergodic literature one must use nontrivial effort to traverse
                the
                text.</p>

            <p>The following definition of interactivity uses parts of the definitions provided above. Interactivity is
                first and foremost responsive. This response is not random, it is relational to the event that triggered
                the
                response. Furthermore, interactivity should require non-trivial effort, it should modify the text in
                some
                fashion and should allow for traversing of the text.</p>

            <p>To expand on non-trivial effort, again relies on the context. What may seem trivial to some is not
                trivial
                to others. For example, clicking the “Next” button can be considered trivial in comparison to clicking
                the
                “Pay” button. The latter action has more significance since it has a more meaningful effect on the user.
            </p>

            <p>Bringing these two terms together, all interactions are events but not all events are interactive. As
                mentioned, the system itself can trigger an event which does not require the user’s interaction. The
                user
                can perform an event which requires a response from the system and this response is not random. However,
                the
                significance of the event and how trivial the event was, will determine whether or not this was a
                display of
                interactivity. Again, clicking the “Next” button is an event however, clicking the “Pay” button is an
                event
                displaying interactivity.</p>
