            Metadata
        </h2>
        <article>
            Metadata is “data about data”. Alternatively, it can be described as a summary of the data. Metadata can be
            used for tags, dates, information about content contributors and access rights. For example, a photo can
            include metadata such as the date and time it was taken and its filename.<br>
            <br>
            Metadata helps to group similar data and helps to organise data. Ontologies such as classes, instances,
            properties and functions are used to define relationships between things. It is easier to add metadata to
            similar datasets when ontologies are employed. This improves discoverability of data. <br>
            <br>
            Metadata is important to use since it will give data context and, thus, the quality of this data is improved
            since its origin is known.<br>
            <br>
            Metadata in HTML is placed between the head tags. Information in this tag is not displayed on the website.
            The meta tag is used to store the metadata about the website. This metadata is used by web crawlers and
            browsers and improves the websites search engine ranking. Some information stored in these meta tags could
            include a description of the page, information about the page creator and instructions to browsers.
            Combining the meta element with other attributes creates “document-level” metadata. For example, within the
            meta element, one could have: name = “abc” content = “xyz”. To give instructions to the browsers, the
            “http-equiv” attribute is used within meta tags. For example, an instruction can direct the browser to
            refresh the page every few minutes. The character set is also written within the meta tag. This establishes
            the character encoding of the page.<br>
