            Semantic Mark-up and HTML5
        </h2>
        <article style = "padding-left: 18%; padding-right: 45%; text-align: justify;">
                Semantic is defined as understanding the meaning of words. Therefore, semantic mark-up provides meaning to elements. Tags must be used for their intended purposes and mark-up is intended to separate content from presentation i.e. not used for stylistic purposes. Semantic mark-up is important for accessibility, which includes Assistive Technologies, bots and search results.<br>
            <br>
                Initially, div was used to visually section websites. However, this did not translate to Assistive Technology users or bots since div does not separate content on the page. This can be seen when any CSS styling is removed. So, HTML5 was created to make use of specific sectioning elements that improve accessibility. Such elements include body, article, section, nav and aside.<br>
            <br>
                The article element is used to contain a singular entity, that can be understood in its own context. For example, a blogpost can be contained within an article tag.<br>
            <br>
                HTML5 also allows for assistive technology to understand the webpage as it should be understood. This is important to allow accessibility in terms of disabilities. For example, the section tag will only be announced when it has an ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) landmark, an accessible name. Likewise, the following tags: main, header, footer, nav are helpful for screen readers. Therefore, it is imperative to design a website so that it is accessible, in this context and others, to the user. For another example, one could use multiple instances of h1 in different sections and, stylistically, the headings will appear in a hierarchy. However, the Assistive Technology would understand them to be on the same level, the accessibility tree isnâ€™t changed. Therefore, one must use h1, h2, h3 etc to ensure a proper hierarchy is seen by the assistive technology.
